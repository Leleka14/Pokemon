## General Info
This project is my test task for TeamVoy company. It is a simple site built with React where you can see general info about pokemons. You can visit it [here](https://leleka14.github.io/Pokemon/). I have used newer version of [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) and also I have fetched images from Pokeres - https://pokeres.bastionbot.org. I couldn't display types of pokemons as they are only available while fetching detailed info about single pokemon and it is very inefficient to do it.

## Getting started
You can install this project locally using npm:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Leleka14/Pokemon.git
$ cd pokemon
$ npm install
$ npm start # open localhost:3000
```

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React version: 17.0.1
* Bootstrap version: 4.5.3
* Reactstrap version: 8.6.0

## Credits
Thanks to [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) and [Pokeres](https://pokeres.bastionbot.org) for Pokemon data
